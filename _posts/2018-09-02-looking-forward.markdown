Let's be honest. Many of us aspire to write in our blogs again. Maybe even some
us go as far as to update their Jekyll theme and throw in a little bit of CSS.
Perhaps we write an update post to get us motivated to start writing again.

In my personal experience, it's been really, *really* hard to get in the habit
of writing. I always get distracted, feel uninspired, or get crippled with fear
at the idea of someone reading and judging my words. I tell myself over and over
again that I *should* be writing. Hell, I encourage other developers all the time
to write everything down so others can learn from it. Being a
hypocrite certainly doesn't help me feel less like an imposter stepping up to my
keyboard.

I'm not sure what it is, really. I can submit a pull request that contributes
code to a new repository without hesitation. I love typing detailed messages
that describe what my work does and how it's going to make The World a Better
Placeâ„¢.

My therapist tells me it's a matter of confidence. I tend to agree with her.

But here it is. And you should certainly know that I'm going to have nightmares
about starting the last two sentences with conjunctions, or how many times I've
said "I" in this post, or the fact that this site at this time doesn't have a
footer. However, I want to write. I want to document my learning. I want to
inspire other developers to do the same. I want to provide context and value and
share stories that a README or a tutorial could only ever hope to provide.

This is my commitment now to start writing, sharing, and contributing. We'll see
how far I get this time.
